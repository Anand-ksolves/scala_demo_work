//It defines a method named main inside a Scala object named Hello
//An object is similar to a class, but you specifically use it when you want a single instance of that class
//If youâ€™re coming to Scala from Java, this means that main is just like a static method (We write more on this later)
//main takes an input parameter named args that is a string array
//Array is a class that wraps the Java array primitive
